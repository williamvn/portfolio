    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Currently, the photon mapping algorithm is one of the main and most complete global ilumination techniques. This
      is
      because it allows you to simulate optical effects such as reflection, refraction, caustics, shadows, and diffuse
      interreflection accurately and efficiently. However, one of the atomic operations of this algorithm, determining
      the first object intersected by a ray, is computationally expensive and can consume up to 95% of rendering time.
      In order to improve the performance of this algorithm, versions such as photon splatting which
      estimate the ilumination in a less complex way, have emerged. However, the performance still depends on the number
      of
      intersection tests performed. This thesis presents a technique to calculate reflections in dynamic 3D scenes. This
      technique uses a quad tree in screen space to speed up the search of ray intersection in screen space. The
      structure is built from the Z-Buffer calculated with a deferred shading, for this reason, it is
      called the hierarchical Z-Buffer (Hi-Z). Hi-Z serves as an acceleration structure for
      adaptive ray marching in screen space, which traverses the scene at different levels of resolution. This technique
      allows the approximate and efficient calculation of the intersection of rays that are not coherent with the
      geometries of the scene. Therefore, it can be used as an intersection function in the photon splatting algorithm,
      thus providing an on-screen version of this algorithm with interactive performances.
